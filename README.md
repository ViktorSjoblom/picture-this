```
1. There is a lot of folders some with repeating picture can be good to clean up if they aren't in use. in folder post/uploads

2. the interface for updating user information is a bit confusing, still nice with so many options but it doesn't seem like it wants to update profile picture.

3. you make good use of @param in functions which makes it easy to understand what your functions do.

4. on functions.php 169 it says "@return string" and you are missing that ":string" on line 172.

5. you are repetitive with a lot of statement like bindParam a suggestion could be to make it into a function

6. on store.php line 54 there is a redirect commented, not sure if it needs to be there

7. something to think about could be that FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING replaces quotes with something else and it can look strange if you were to use words that use them.

8. something to think about is to comment more like you have in login.php even thought you write nice and clean code that's easy to read

9. you check if use is logged in often with the function a suggestion would be to have it checked once then the user is able to reach user data etc but you do make secure instagram-clone

10. You write nice and readable code the page works fine and have a nice theme it's hard to find any faults with it i'm just picking crumbs when i wrote my comments and you have done a good jobb and deserves 10/10 likes
